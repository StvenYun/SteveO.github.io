            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Steven Yun, but my friends call me SteveO. I am a recent graduate of Stony Brook
                University with a degree in Mathematics and a double major in Applied Math. I am currently looking for
                opportunities that will challenge me on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all of the free time acquired during the pandemic, I took it upon myself to be constantly learning
                new technologies that I could use to solve real world problems. I also happened to spend a lot of time
                in
                a Discord with my friends who are software engineers and fellow PC gamers. Alast, I came up with a great
                project idea; a discord bot for our discord server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, we were looking for a bot that would announce when somebody joined the voice call so we
                wouldn't have to alt-tab to the discord client. It seemed no such bot existed that was active at the
                time so I took it upon myself to start reading the discord.py docs and seeing what I could do with the
                library.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started off small and worked my way up. The first bot I made that was useful in our server was a bot
                for our favorite PC game, League of Legends. The first command returned a link for an individual's op.gg
                link which returned stats of the player. It has since evolved to an ebedded message that contained all
                of
                that information without needing to return a link that sends you to another page!
            </p>
            <p>
                I continued to look for other projects that I could make with this discord library. Since the beginning
                of the pandemic, I took interest in the stock market, and bio-tech stocks in specific. I spent days
                staring at my robinhood account portfolio to see many green and just as many red days. This gave me the
                idea of creating a fantasy stock trading bot which would allow us to look up prices/data, buy/sell, and
                pull up a portfolio. This would allow me and my friends to trade and talk about the market without the
                risk of losing money. I quickly got to work on devloping this. This was the first time I would be
                working with a database and I quickly came to realize how powerful an asset they can be. I had a friend
                help me map out the database and I went to work.
            </p>
            <p>
                After finishing the stock bot, we finally came back around to our initial problem. We still wanted a bot
                that would announce when somebody joined the voice call. At this point I was very familiar with the
                discord.py library and I knew exactly what I needed to do to make this happen. These bots can be found
                in the discord bots section of my projects. This has sparked my interest in devloping and I hope to
                continue to learn and apply my knowledge in the world of development.
